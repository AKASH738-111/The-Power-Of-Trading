<h2>About The Power Of Trading</h2>

<p>
The Power Of Trading is not just a course or a learning platform — it is a complete trading ecosystem built with the vision of making trading simple, logical, and profitable for every individual, even for those who have zero prior market knowledge.
</p>

<p>
This platform was founded by <b>Akash Rajput</b>, a professional trader and Data Engineer with over <b>7+ years of solid experience</b> in the Indian Stock Market as well as the International Forex Market. Over the years, Akash observed one common problem in the trading industry — most people lose money not because trading is risky, but because they lack a structured, data-driven system.
</p>

<p>
Unlike traditional trading educators who focus only on indicators or theory, The Power Of Trading is built on real market data, statistical probability, and technology-driven decision making. Akash Rajput used his background in Data Engineering to design a unique trading system where even non-technical people can understand market movements and execute trades confidently.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this platform is very clear — to eliminate confusion, emotional trading, and blind tips. Students are trained to understand market structure, institutional activity, price behavior, and risk management in such a way that trading becomes a professional skill, not gambling.
</p>

<p>
Till date, more than <b>1000+ students</b> from different states of India have been mentored through this system. Many of them started as complete beginners and are now consistently executing trades with discipline and confidence.
</p>

<p>
The Power Of Trading is one of the very few platforms in India that combines <b>market experience + data science + automation logic</b>. This allows traders to follow a repeatable system instead of emotional decision making. Our long-term vision is to make professional trading accessible from home, without dependency on tips, calls, or luck.
