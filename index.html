<h2>About The Power Of Trading</h2>

<div class="card">
<p>
The Power Of Trading was founded with a single mission — to remove confusion, fear, and randomness from trading.
Most people fail in the market not because they lack money, but because they lack a structured system, data-based thinking, and the right mentorship.
</p>

<p>
I am <b>Akash Rajput</b>, founder of The Power Of Trading, with over <b>7+ years of hands-on experience</b> in the Indian equity market as well as the global Forex market.
My journey was not easy — like most traders, I faced losses, emotional mistakes, over-trading, and misinformation.
But instead of quitting, I chose to understand the market from its core — through <b>data, probability, and logic</b>.
</p>

<p>
Alongside trading, I am also a <b>Data Engineer</b>. This technical background helped me analyze markets in a way most retail traders never do.
Instead of guessing price movement, I started building systems — systems that track behavior of institutions, liquidity flow, volume structure, and time-based probabilities.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, I combined my trading experience with my technology skills and built a <b>step-by-step learning framework</b>.
This framework is designed in such a way that even someone who has <b>zero prior trading knowledge</b> can slowly, safely, and confidently understand how the market actually works.
</p>

<p>
Today, The Power Of Trading is not just a course — it is a <b>complete trading ecosystem</b>.
An ecosystem where students learn:
<br>• How professional traders think
<br>• How institutions move money
<br>• How to control emotions using rules
<br>• How to trade with discipline, not hope
</p>

<p>
So far, I have mentored <b>1000+ students</b> from different states of India.
Many of them were beginners, working professionals, and even people who were afraid of trading.
Through proper guidance and systems, they are now trading independently and responsibly.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the <b>very few courses in India</b> that focuses on real market logic instead of shortcuts.
Our goal is simple — to make trading <b>understandable, structured, and achievable</b> for common people.
